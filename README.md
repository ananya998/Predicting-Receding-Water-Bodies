# Problem statement
*There are a lot of water bodies and reservoirs in the world which are depreciating at a very fast pace and certain steps need to be taken to ensure these levels are made stable.*

# Objective
*Using ML and Satellite images dataset we will be predicting if a water body will be receding in the future or not by keeping track of groundwater levels from the past records to learn the variables involved in future water level fluctuatiuons*
# Dataset Used
_This data set provides the water quality classifications of New York State's lakes, rivers, streams and ponds, collectively referred to as waterbodies. All water bodies in the state are provided a water quality classification based on existing, or expected best usage, of each waterbody or waterbody segment. Under New York State's Environmental Conservation Law (ECL)_
